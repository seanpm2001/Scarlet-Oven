# I chose Ruby as the main project language file for this project (Scarlet Oven) as for software diversity reasons, I can't write everything purely in Python. I don't have very many Ruby projects at the moment, and I feel like it would be good to write this program in Ruby. Rubys are typically red, and the Ruby logo will likely always be red, so it can partially support the color theme for this project as well.
